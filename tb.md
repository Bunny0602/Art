**Tuberculosis (TB)** is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, primarily affecting the lungs but potentially impacting other organs. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

### Signs and Symptoms:
1. **Persistent Cough**: Lasts over three weeks, often with phlegm or blood.
2. **Chest Pain**: Discomfort that may worsen with breathing or coughing.
3. **Fatigue**: Persistent weakness or tiredness.
4. **Weight Loss**: Significant, unintentional loss.
5. **Night Sweats**: Excessive sweating during sleep.
6. **Fever**: Low-grade and persistent.
7. **Chills**: Episodes of feeling cold with shivering.

### Transmission:
TB is mainly spread through airborne particles, with higher risks associated with close and prolonged contact with an infected person. Environmental factors, like poor ventilation, can also enhance transmission.

### Prevention:
To reduce risk, wear masks, improve indoor ventilation, and ensure timely treatment for those infected. If you experience symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has TB, seek medical attention promptly for early diagnosis and treatment.

### Dr. Mario Raviglione's Contributions:
Dr. Mario Raviglione is a leading expert in TB research and public health. His work focuses on:

1. **Global Health Initiatives**: Advocating for comprehensive TB programs that combine treatment, prevention, and research.
   
2. **Drug-Resistant TB**: Addressing the growing challenge of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the need for new treatment strategies.

3. **Policy Development**: Influencing policies to improve TB diagnosis, treatment access, and funding for public health initiatives.

4. **Health Systems Strengthening**: Focusing on enhancing healthcare systems to better tackle TB and related diseases.

Dr. Raviglione's research and advocacy have significantly shaped global TB strategies and increased awareness of the disease's complexities, underscoring the importance of ongoing research and intervention.
